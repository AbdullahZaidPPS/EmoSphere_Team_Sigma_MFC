Loneliness and isolation are major risk factors for depression. Video conferencing can help people to feel more connected to others, but it is still difficult to provide emotional support through video conferencing. Not everyone gets a friend due to fear of judgement so AI will be the best choice to open up and feel free.
A video conferencing AI friend could provide emotional support and companionship to people who are feeling low/sad/depressed. The AI friend could interact with people in a natural and engaging way, and it could provide tasks and activities to help people improve their mood and well-being.
